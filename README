___MAIN FILES___

GUI_ACE_Inhib_PKPD.m & .fig
   Runs the model interactively with a graphical user interface. Designed for 
   educational use for students in grades 6-12 and undergraduate students.
 
OR
  
run_PKPD_without_GUI.m
   Runs the model manually either in the Editor or by passing arguments in the
   command line. Can run more cases that allowable in the GUI and can specify
   plot_mode to show more plots than available through GUI or to produce and 
   save publication-quality plots.

___SUPPLEMENTARY FILES___

PKPD_ACE_Inhibition_AngII.m
   The central file that uses case-specific parameters and dosing information 
   as input to the PKPD model of ACE inhibitor dose impact on AngII plasma 
   concentration. Output includes the vectors of time and the concentrations of 
   the drug, diacid form, AngI, AngII, and Renin and the percent of inhibition 
   (not in this order).
*** Don't run this file directly. Instead let it be called by either 
   call_PKPD_model_scalar.m or call_PKPD_model_vector_param_est.m
   (described subsequently) that correctly define all the input values.

setup_mat_for_PK_params.m 
   All PK parameters for the drug/renalfunction combinations are edited and 
   written to .mat files for use in other routines.

setup_mat_for_data_estimated_params.m
   All data for parameter estimation and the estimated parameters are edited and
   written to .mat files for use in other routines.
   
run_params.m
   Sets the input values that GUI_ACE_Inhib_PKPD.m sets interactively. It is
   used as a default input through a .mat file for run_PKPD_without_GUI.m and 
   param_estimation.m.

call_PKPD_model_vector_param_est.m
   Sets up parameters once before a loop through tfinal_dosing vector calling
   PKPD_ACE_Inhibition_AngII.m at each loop iteration. Output is the vector of  
   Y values used for parameter estimation comparison to data.
   
call_PKPD_model_scalar.m
   Used by GUI_ACE_Inhib_PKPD.m, run_PKPD_without_GUI.m, and param_estimation.m. 
   Sets up parameters before calling PKPD_ACE_Inhibition_AngII.m for a scalar 
   value of tfinal_dosing. Output is all of the output from 
   PKPD_ACE_Inhibition_AngII.m with options for plotting and saving figures
   through plot_mode string.
   
*.mat
   Needed to run the programs to pass data, parameters, and calculated values.
   
/pub_plots/.
   Subdirectory where plots are stored when plot_mode = 'pub_plots'
   
export_fig.m
   MATLAB package to nicely export figures.
